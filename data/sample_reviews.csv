review
This movie was amazing and full of surprises!
It was a waste of time and very boring.
I enjoyed the acting but the plot was predictable.
Terrible effects and awful script.
Absolutely brilliant. A must-watch!
I fell asleep halfway through. Not engaging.
An emotional rollercoaster. Beautifully made.
The dialogue was weak and the pacing was off.
Highly recommend it to everyone.
One of the worst movies Iâ€™ve ever seen.
